# 2023-Uni-work
When pulling changes from COMP2000 repo into here, remember to delete the hidden file "git" inside the branch of the pulled repo so you won't have a folder with an arrow meaning a git submodule has been created.
Each week they will have a branch called week2,3,4... and delete ".git" files inside of them.
